# Who is this and what have you done with my CPAN {#Cover}

## Does size matter?

- sheer magnitude
- growth rate
- ...Yes, it matters because of what it represents:
    1. ...mindshare/userbase
    2. ...inertia
    3. ...which feed into each other, naturally


## Who Has a "CPAN"?

* Typical: "there ainâ€™t no CPAN for Python" "..Ruby" "..JavaScript" - blogs.perl.org - Jan 2012
* ...But why mention those languages?
* ...Why not Java and the innumerable other JVM language ports/implementations that have access to all the same libraries?
* ...Why not the Microsoft languages and the umpteen languages on .NET (CLR/mono)?


## Not just size matters

- Language Archive Matchup Game


## Observations:

1. ...Junk level on RubyGems and PyPi is extremely high
2. ...Hackage tends toward precise "known" algorithm and standardized protocal implementation, emphasizes co-composability - "one or two best [only] ways to do everything"
3. ...node's npm tends toward language and orientation/paradigm tweaking - DSLs and JS dialects as well as paradigm-importing combinators and shortcuts


## Observations:

4. ...Maven STRONGLY tends toward enterprise software and interopability plugins
5. ...NuGet tends toward library bindings and components/plugins of existing componentized/pluggable software systems
6. ...Packagist is currently too small and growing too slowly to matter.  ...(Can you make abstractions and design for modularity in PHP?)
7. ...CPAN is a mix of all of the above.

## Conclusion:

- ...Don't just say "Perl has CPAN, 'nuff said" - JS, Java, and .NET are bigger (and more importantly, growing far more quickly).
- ...Qualify your love for CPAN by specifying the specific distinctives you appreciate
    1. ...CPANTesters network and platform support matrix
    2. ...(optional) integrated bug tracking and communication with author

## Conclusion:

- Qualify your love for CPAN by specifying the specific distinctives you appreciate
    3. ...ability to take over namespaces of dead or just unmaintained stuff
    4. ...awesome documentation a cultural standard
    5. ...runs the integrated test suite upon install

## Conclusions:

- Qualify your love for CPAN by specifying the specific distinctives you appreciate
    6. ...pretty good searching
    7. ...very mature authentication, upload, and permission management system, with namespace claiming/approval
    8. ...distribution ratings/reviews
